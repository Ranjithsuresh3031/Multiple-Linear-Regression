Project Title: Multiple Linear Regression on Diamonds Dataset

Description:
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Diamonds dataset using Seaborn and StatsModels in Python. Explored relationships between various diamond attributes and prices through data visualization and statistical modeling.

Key Contributions:

    Utilized Seaborn for data visualization, uncovering insights through pair plots.
    Employed multiple linear regression to model the relationship between diamond features (carat,depth) and price.
    Transformed categorical variables into dummy variables to incorporate them into the regression model.
    Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
    Conducted model evaluation using statistical metrics such as Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error.
    Created visualizations to compare actual diamond prices with model-predicted prices.

Outcome:
Developed a robust multiple linear regression model that accurately predicts diamond prices based on their attributes. This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization, showcasing a data-driven approach to problem-solving.
